# Implementing-A-star-search

This file contains a Python implementation of the A-star search algorithm for efficient path finding. 

The function shortest_path takes the following inputs:
- M: Map
- Start: start node
- Goal: goal node

The function creates a Graph using the provided map, converting cities to nodes and adding roads as edges. 

Thereafter, the A-star search algorithm is used to return the shortest path from start node to end node in the form of a list.
